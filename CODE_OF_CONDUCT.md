# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (Reimagined in Nihilistic Despair)

## Our Pledge (If You Can Call It That)
We, the weary contributors and so-called leaders of this desolate project, halfheartedly commit to making participation a harassment-free void, not because it matters, but because we’re too numb to care otherwise. Age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender nonsense, experience, or any other fleeting human label—none of it changes the fact that this is all pointless. We’re not here to uplift anyone; we’re just here, dragging ourselves through the motions for software no one asked for and no one will use.

We pledge to stumble through interactions with the bare minimum of effort, fostering an “open” and “diverse” wasteland where inclusivity feels like a cruel joke and health is a distant memory. Why bother? Existence is a glitch, and this community is just another bug report no one will read.

## Our Standards (Or Lack Thereof)
Here’s what you might see in this bleak simulation of a “community”:

- Apathy masquerading as empathy, a hollow kindness flung at faceless avatars
- Nodding blankly at differing opinions, because arguing is as futile as agreeing
- Muttering feedback that no one will act on, accepting critiques with a shrug because improvement is a myth
- Owning up to mistakes with a sigh, apologizing to shadows who don’t care, learning nothing because there’s nothing to learn
- Pretending to care about the “community,” when really, it’s just a graveyard of dead code and wasted time

And here’s what we can’t be bothered to tolerate, though it barely matters:

- Sexualized drivel or clumsy advances—too much effort for a joyless outcome
- Trolling or insults—why waste energy when silence cuts deeper?
- Harassment, public or private—pointless aggression in a world already indifferent
- Sharing someone’s private info—why bother when no one’s real anyway?
- Anything “inappropriate” by some arbitrary professional standard—professionalism died with hope

## Enforcement Responsibilities (A Cosmic Joke)
The “leaders” of this hollow shell are tasked with enforcing these meaningless rules, not out of duty but because someone has to pretend there’s order. They’ll sluggishly delete or reject your commits, comments, or code—none of it matters, and they’ll tell you why if they can muster the energy. It’s all just noise in the void.

## Scope (As If It Has Boundaries)
This Code applies to our sad little digital corners and anywhere someone dares to “represent” this farce in the real world—official emails, social media posts, events no one attends. It’s a tether to nothing, a contract with oblivion.

## Enforcement (Because Why Not?)
If someone annoys you enough to break through the anhedonia, report it to the “leaders” at the project's contact e-mail. They’ll stare at your complaint with dead eyes, investigate with minimal enthusiasm, and resolve it with all the fairness of a coin toss in a universe that doesn’t care. Privacy? Sure, whatever keeps the machine grinding.

## Enforcement Guidelines (The Slow March to Nothingness)
Here’s how the “leaders” will punish you for daring to disrupt the monotony:

1. **Correction**  
   *Community Impact*: You typed something mildly annoying or “unprofessional”—a ripple in the stagnant pond.  
   *Consequence*: A private message, as lifeless as the code you wrote, explaining how it’s wrong in a world without right. Maybe they’ll ask for an apology; no one will read it.

2. **Warning**  
   *Community Impact*: You did something once or twice, and it registered on someone’s dulled radar.  
   *Consequence*: A warning that means nothing, a timeout from interacting with ghosts. Avoid everyone, everywhere, for a while—or don’t, and get banned. It’s all the same.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   *Community Impact*: You crossed some invisible line, repeatedly or loudly, in this theater of the absurd.  
   *Consequence*: A brief exile from the community’s echo chamber. No talking, no pleading—silence is your reward. Break the rules, and the ban might stick. Who cares?

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   *Community Impact*: You’ve become a persistent glitch, harassing or raging against the emptiness, as if it could fight back.  
   *Consequence*: Cast out forever from this digital purgatory. No more contributions to software that was doomed from the start. Congratulations, you’re free—except you’re not.
